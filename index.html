    <!-- This line needs to be checked <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
This tag is used for implementing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. The example above 
is in the format of a Laravel Blade template, which generates a unique CSRF token for each request. 
Other server-side frameworks may use different syntax for generating and inserting a CSRF token.

<form action="/submit-form" method="post">
This tag specifies the action and method for a form. When the user submits the form, 
the data is sent to the specified URL via the specified HTTP method (POST in this case). 
You should always specify the action and method for your forms to prevent attackers from modifying
the URL or HTTP method to exploit vulnerabilities.
